Sometimes only a grilled cheese sandwich will do. You know what I mean Likewise, sometimes a grilled cheese sandwich is the only vegetarian option I can find.|0
So, here we are, and here is my favorite grilled cheese recipe. It is truly epic, as far as Im concerned. Keep on reading for my tips and tricks, because I have a few|0
Ive sampled a lot of the grilled cheese ideas out there (including mayo on the outside), and these are the ones that work for me.|0
Sharp cheddar has a lot of flavor, and thats what were going for. When it comes to a grilled cheese, you really cant go light on the cheese, or youre going to be disappointed.|0
Pre-shredded cheeses are lightly coated in starch so they dont stick together, but the starch prevents your cheese from melting into gooey oblivion. We want gooey oblivion.|0
This helps trap the heat, which ensures that your grilled cheese has time to melt all the way through without burning on the outside.|0
Thats it Ready to make the best grilled cheese sandwich youve ever had Theyre perfect for chilly or rainy days, and even better with a side of classic tomato soup.|0
Please let me know how these sandwiches turn out for you in the comments I hope you love them as much as I do.|0
Craving more meatless sandwiches Here are a few of my favorites:|0
This roasted vegetable and balsamic grilled cheese sandwich puts these principles to work, but replaces some of the cheese with roasted veggies. You cant go wrong here.|0
This fresh hummus and pickled vegetable sandwich is absurdly tasty. The components are worth the effort, and you can make these sandwiches all week long.|0
My broccoli pita sandwiches feature a fresh broccoli and chickpea salad stuffed into warmed pita slathered with mashed avocado.|0

2 large slices of whole grain sourdough, or your favorite crusty bread|1
Enough Dijon mustard for a thin layer across one slice of bread (about 1 teaspoons)|1
1 cup lightly packed (3 ounces) freshly grated sharp cheddar cheese, plus a little more for sprinkling on the outside (optional)|1
2 teaspoons chopped green onion, green parts only|1
Unsalted butter, for melting in the pan (about 2 teaspoons)|1
Spread Dijon mustard lightly across one side of one slice of bread. Youre aiming for a very thin layer. Stir the green onion into the grated cheese, and set aside.|0
Remove the sandwich with your spatula. Place it onto a cutting board and let it cool for a minute or two. Gently cut it in half down the middle using a serrated knife, and serve warm.|0
