1 tbsp dried oregano|1
2 tbsp olive oil|1
1/2 tsp salt|1
For the Caesar dressing:|0
250 ml plain Greek yogurt|1
juice of 1/2 lemon|1
30 g anchovy fillets, minced (optional)|1
1/2 tsp garlic powder|1
1/2 tbsp Dijon mustard|1
For salad:|0
2 medium avocado, pitted and chopped|1
2 tablespoons chives, chopped (to garnish)|1
4 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and quartered|1
