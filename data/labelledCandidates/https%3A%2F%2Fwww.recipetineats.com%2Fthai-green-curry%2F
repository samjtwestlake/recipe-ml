Make this with chicken or even entirely meat free. With a sauce this good, you can put anything in it and it will taste amazing|0
The single most requested recipe is finally here We love the colour, the spiciness, and how fragrant the creamy sauce is.|0
Along with Pad Thai, Chicken Satay and Thai Red Curry, green curry is the gold standard by which we rate Thai restaurants.|0
Its the curry we sweat and swear our way through, guzzling down water and wiping our brows when we confidently tell the waiter give it to us the way it should be extra spicy|0
Luckily, when we make it at home, we can dial back the spiciness substantially. Whether made with curry paste in a jar OR homemade green curry paste|0
This can be a quick 30 minute Thai Green Curry made with store bought curry paste OR go all out with a homemade curry paste|0
Maesri yields the closest result to homemade green curry paste. I find the other brands to be too sweet with less green curry flavour and strangely, they are spicier|0
Its inevitable using any curry paste out of a jar rather than making it from scratch that the curry will be lacking a certain freshness.|0
So what I do is freshen it up using fresh garlic, ginger and lemongrass.|0
Because quick and easy is the go here, I usually dont even use fresh lemongrass, I use lemongrass paste. It works a treat|0
But its very easy to switch it out for another protein of choice, or to make it meat free so Ive included directions in the recipe.|0
In addition to the curry paste (and pimping it up, if using jar paste), theres actually not that many ingredients in Thai Green Curry.|0
Coconut milk full fat please Fat is where the flavour is, if you use low fat coconut milk the sauce will lack flavour. You could even use coconut cream, if you want a richer version|0

Chicken or vegetable broth chicken is better (deeper flavours) but vegetable is fine if making a vegetarian version.|0

Fish sauce may not be needed if using paste from a jar. Yes its stinky but its essential for Thai curries and once cooked, it doesnt taste fishy at all|0

If you make your own green curry paste, you can skip the spicy chillies without compromising on flavour|0
The making part is very straightforward which is why if you use curry paste from a jar, green curry is something you can have any night of the week.|0
The essential step here is to fry off the curry paste, whether using store bought or homemade. This is the equivalent to sauting garlic until golden, a step used in virtually all my savoury recipes.|0
The homemade curry paste version is also slightly greener owing to the fresh chillies and coriander/cilantro blitzed into the paste.|0
Very fragrant from all the herbs and aromatics in the curry paste. It has a less in your face flavour compared to Thai Red Curry but its more fragrant with chilli than Thai Yellow Curry.|0
