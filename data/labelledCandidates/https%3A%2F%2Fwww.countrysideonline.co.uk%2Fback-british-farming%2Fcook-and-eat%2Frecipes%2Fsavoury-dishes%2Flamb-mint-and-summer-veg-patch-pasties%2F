There really is little better than a parcel of meltingly good meat and vegetables wrapped in golden crispy pastry. This recipe is a bit like a roast lunch that is perfect to munch in one handful|0
For the pastry:|0
500g strong white bread flour|1
120g butter|1
120g vegetable fat or lard|1
a tsp of sea salt|1
170ml cold water|1
For the filling:|0
300g British lamb steak, coarsely chopped (replace with lamb mince if easier or to hand)|1
150g potatoes (1 medium potato)|1
100g courgette, chopped into small pieces|1
250g summer squash or butternut squash, peeled and chopped|1
Half an onion, coarsely chopped|1
2 spring onions, or chives|1
1 tsp of wholegrain mustard|1
Salt and pepper|1
Fresh mint leaves|1
Thyme leaves|1
1 egg, to brush before baking 50g butter to add when filling|0
Preheat the oven to 200 degrees.|0
Wrap tightly in cling film and rest in the fridge for 3-4 hours.|0
Or use 2 packets of ready-made puff pastry.|0
For the filling, chop all the vegetables and potatoes into chunks of roughly the same size.|0
Use a sharp knife or scissors to cut the meat into pieces about 2cms in size.|0
Put the vegetables and the meat into a mixing bowl and add the mustard and herbs, season well with salt and pepper, and stir well so all the ingredients are evenly distributed.|0
Roll out the pastry, use a side plate to cut out circles of dough, lay them on a piece of baking paper.|0
Heap a generous amount of the filling onto one half of each circle of dough, add a dollop of butter before closing.|0
Pull together both sides of the pastry and pinch the pastry to crimp the edge and seal in the filling.|0
Line a flat baking tray with non-stick baking paper.|0
Place the pasties on top and brush well with the beaten egg.|0
Put into the preheated oven and bake for about 40-45 minutes or until golden.|0
If you are using shop-bought pastry, you will need to turn the pasties over after about half an hour to avoid soggy bottoms|0
