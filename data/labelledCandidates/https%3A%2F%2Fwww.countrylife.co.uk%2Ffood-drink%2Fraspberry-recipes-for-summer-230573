Melanie Johnson makes the most of juicy British raspberries with these sweet recipes.|0
Raspberries with all their summer sweetness are simply delicious paired with pistachio in this British take on a classic Paris Brest.|0

For the choux|0
220ml water|1
85g butter|1
105g plain flour, stirred through with a pinch of salt and 1tspn of caster sugar|1
3 eggs|1
For the filling|0
600ml double cream 100g ready-made pistachio paste 150g ready-made thick custard 50g icing sugar|0
600ml double cream|1
100g ready-made pistachio paste|1
150g ready-made thick custard|1
50g icing sugar|1
Preheat your oven to 180C/ 350F/gas mark 4 and line a baking tray with baking parchment. Mark a 9in circle on the reverse of the paper to act as a guide for where to place your choux.|0
Bake for 45 minutes, until golden and puffed. Cool on a wire rack and then slice in half horizontally.|0
To make the filling, whip the cream until it is quite stiff and fold through the pistachio paste, custard and icing sugar. Add to a piping bag.|0
Serve the pistachio choux with a glass of ros for an afternoon treat.|0
Preheat the oven to 200C and brush a madeleine tray with melted butter.|0
Whisk together in a bowl two eggs and 100g caster sugar. Add 100g plain flour, 1 tspn of baking powder, the juice and zest of one lemon and 100g melted butter. Whisk to combine.|0
Rest the mixture for 15 minutes. Pour the mixture into the tray and bury a fresh raspberry in each shell, tucking it beneath the mixture.|0
Bake for 810 minutes. Cool and remove from the moulds.|0
Add a spoonful of melted white chocolate to each hole and press the madeleines gently back in so the chocolate comes up the sides and coats one half of the madeleine.|0
Freeze for about 15 minutes to set the chocolate, then gently ease from the tray and serve.|0
Let it sit for a minute before stirring until smooth. Divide between four ramekins, filling each halfway. Dot the tops with raspberries, followed by more chocolate mixture.|0
Finally, decorate the tops with extra raspberries, grated chocolate, mini meringues and edible flowers for a perfect summer dinner-party pudding.|0

Strawberries and cream are sublime on their own but sometimes you need to help them up their game still further. Credit: Alamy|0
