Lean and green: best served alongside a paratha flatbread|0
Lean and green: best served alongside a paratha flatbread|0
(Ed Law )|0
Growing up in India when I did, my parents didnt freeze food to keep it for longer.|0
I was used to pickling things in order to preserve them, or turning them into chutneys, or fermenting them. I also remember my mum prolonged things by making syrups too.|0
So after I moved to the UK, I discovered the frozen aisles in supermarkets with a wide range of frozen ingredients.|0
The concept of frozen vegetables was new to me. Back home, peas were something we enjoyed helping our mum or dad take out of the pod. They were very fresh and in season.|0
In the UK, however, a bag of frozen peas is something practically everyone will all have in their freezer, regardless of when theyre in season. And you wont have to shell them either.|0
This green pea recipe, also known as matar ki, is a great side dish and can be eaten with a paratha.|0
Matar ki sabzi|0
5tsp oil|1
1tsp cumin seeds|1
150g white onion, sliced thinly|1
6g garlic, sliced thinly|1
2 green chillies chopped, seeds in|1
1tsp ground turmeric|1
1tsp salt|1
2tsp ground coriander|1
150ml coconut milk|1
300g frozen peas (washed in cold water and then drained)|1
handful of fresh coriander chopped|1
Add ground turmeric, salt, and ground coriander, mix and cook for a minute. Next add frozen peas and cook for 2 minutes.|0
Once the peas are coated in the mixture add the coconut milk, lower heat and cover the pan with a lid and cook for 3-4 minutes. Just before switching the heat add the coriander and stir into the peas.|0
Serve hot with roti, rice or with pitta bread. Cut the pitta breads in half to make pockets and fill with the sabzi.|0
