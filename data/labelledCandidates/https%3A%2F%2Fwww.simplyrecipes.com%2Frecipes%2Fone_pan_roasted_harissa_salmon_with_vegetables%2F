When Im looking for a few oohs and ahs at the dinner table, but dont want to fuss or wash a bunch of dishes, I turn to this simple roasted salmon.|0
Oh, and I did I mention, the whole thing is cooked on one baking sheet Beautiful, tasty, and easy to clean up My kind of dinner.|0
There are several good dry harissa blends available online and in well-stocked grocery stores. Be sure to get the dry blend, not the paste, for this recipe.|0
The other key to this recipe is to give the veggies a quick roast in the oven before adding the salmon. That way, the veggies get nice and roasted, but the salmon doesnt get over cooked.|0
