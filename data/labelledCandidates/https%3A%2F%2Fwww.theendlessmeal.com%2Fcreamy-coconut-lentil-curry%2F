I dont care how hot it is outside, its always a good time for a bowl of hot curry. I mean, its stinkin hot in India and peeps eat curry there all the time. They must be onto something.|0

The original recipe comes from a well dog-eared cookbook of mine called, Vijs at Home. Ive made some changes to the original recipe so it suits my taste:|0
Coconut oil replaces the cooking oil (and I use MUCH less of it)|0
Coriander seeds replace ground coriander as I love the little pop of crunch they give.|0
Crushed tomatoes replace fresh tomatoes (so I can be lazy and not blend them)|0
Harder to find mung beans take a hike and are replaced with brown lentils|0
Cilantro gets piled on high.|0
Cherry tomatoes get thrown in during the last few minutes of cooking (because heck, why not)|0
